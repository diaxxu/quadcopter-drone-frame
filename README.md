#  Quadcopter Drone Frame 

This is my **first custom drone frame** designed in CAD   
Inspired by DJI-style quadcopters – compact, symmetrical, and optimized for stability.

## 📐 Design Overview

- **Frame Type:** X-Layout Quadcopter  
- **Motor Count:** 4 (brushless)  
- **Material (planned):** Carbon fiber or laser-cut plywood for prototyping  
- **Mounting:** Motors mounted using standard 16x16mm hole pattern  
- **Center Plate:** Stacked design for FC, ESC, battery, and GPS  
- **Prop Size:** Supports 5” to 7” props (depending on arm length)  
- **Modular Arms:** Simple arm geometry for fast replacement and minimal weight

## 🧠 Design Goals

- ✨ Clean symmetrical layout for flight stability  
- 🔩 Easy to build and repair (modular arms + simple stack)  
- ⚙️ Designed for future expansion (GPS, camera, telemetry, etc.)  
- 🪶 Lightweight, optimized for both manual FPV or autonomous missions

## 🛠️ Made With

- **Fusion 360** for CAD  
- **Blender / Cura (optional)** for slicing 3D printable prototypes  
- **Laser Cutter / CNC Router** (planned for final version)
